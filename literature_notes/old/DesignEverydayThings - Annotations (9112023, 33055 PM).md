If this feeling covers a group of tasks, the result can be severe difficulties coping with life. In the extreme case, such learned helplessness leads to depression and to a belief that the person cannot cope with everyday life at all.

The phenomenon has been most frequently studied as a precursor to the clinical problem of depression, but it might easily arise with a few bad experiences with everyday objects.”</span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F11826352%2Fitems%2F7BQJQGEJ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2258%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">“The design of everyday things”, p. 58</span>)</span> very interesting to see the relationship between helplessnes, depression, and inability to use everyday objects
