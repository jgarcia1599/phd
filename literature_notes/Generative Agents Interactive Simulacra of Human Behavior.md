title: Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior
date: 2023-11-21
---

In Generative Agents, the authors created a simulation environment whereby each generative agent takes on the role of a citizen of a fictional town called Smallville. To enable generative agents, the authors provide an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent’s experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. The architecture is accessed through a function that takes the current situation/question as input and returns a subset of the memories as context for the agent to take more steps.   The three main factors when retrieving memories are relevance, recency, and importance. To evaluate this work, the authors “interview” agents after a two-day simulation to probe their ability to remember past experiences, plan future actions based on their experiences, react appropriately to unexpected events, and reflect on their performance to improve their future actions.
