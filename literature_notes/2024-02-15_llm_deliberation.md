In LLM deliberation, the authors show various negotiation games used to probe LLM's reasoning capability in a multi-party simulation context. They also introduce an open-source benchmark for conducting future games. The primary game evaluated is derived from a negotiation role-play involving six participants and five issues. The study also examines different game variations and prompt strategies to improve and test the agent's reasoning capabilities. For the evaluation process, the researchers conducted 24 simulation rounds, organizing the six agents into four different sequences (ensuring each agent participates four times) to test their performance. They assessed the outcomes using several metrics they developed, such as overall success rate, any level of success achieved, individual scores, collective scores, and instances of incorrect agreements.
