00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,260
Welcome to CREST. A group of users 
can collaboratively search for and  

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,120
book a property to live in using CREST.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,140
Ayala, Miguel and Nick will be using CREST 
to find a place in New York for the summer.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,200
CREST addresses several challenges

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,520
There are no tools that provide both 
collaborative search and agreement support. So  

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,040
Ayala, Miguel and Nick will have to 
use three or more different tools:  

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,520
Airbnb to search, chat and email to 
share their findings and a google  

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,660
spreadsheet to keep track of their preferred 
properties, budgets and terms and conditions.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,840
Sometimes their efforts might feel 
discontinuous and it is difficult  

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,820
to coordinate remotely and asynchronously.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,080
Without a clear goal-oriented 
process, team members can waste  

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,500
time exploring properties that might not 
contribute to the overall team’s needs.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,360
It is difficult, even among friends,  

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,300
to find ways to negotiate or work 
around conflicting preferences.

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,240
Only one in the group can 
effectively book for the team;  

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,620
stripping the other members of their ability 
to explicitly agree or disagree to a property.

17
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,960
CREST and its friendly mediating now addresses 
all of the aforementioned challenges.

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,584
Crests supports the main actions involved in group  

19
00:00:58,584 --> 00:00:59,220
property-booking: search, 
discussion and agreement.

20
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,840
Hi im Ayala and I'm from kazakhstan. I'm really 
excited to be living with two of my best friends  

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,160
this summer in New York City. I'm a junior 
architect studying the empire state building  

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,960
so I would need to be within walking distance of 
it, but I can only afford 300 dollars per month.

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,640
Hi im Nick, i'm a linguistics graduate student 
and I am enrolled in a coding intensive bootcamp  

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,510
this summer in New York City. All I need is a 
place to stay during the night and sleep and I  

25
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:35,040
am a really good cook, so I can cook for rent, but 
my monthly budget is only 150 dollars per month.

26
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,420
Hello I'm Miguel and I live in Mexico City. I 
really care about shopping and living in style.  

27
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,340
For me the most important thing is to have my 
own bathroom and a very, very clean kitchen.  

28
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,440
I've been saving up for this trip and I think I 
can afford to spend around 600 dollars a month.

29
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,900
Miguel starts using CREST, sets his budget 
to 600 dollars, and he then adds Wi-Fi,  

30
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,700
Kitchen, and Cable TV as preferences.

31
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,400
Ayala sets her budget to 300 
dollars and adds being close  

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,200
to the Empire State Building as a preference.

33
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,580
Ayala explores the properties in the search 
results lists by looking at some images.  

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,440
These properties can be sorted 
by relevance, price, or ratings.

35
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,040
Users receive messages from CREST-Bot, our 
automated mediation agent, in many places in the  

36
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,900
app, like the property item and the chat. These 
carefully curated interventions derive inspiration  

37
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,580
from legal mediation literature and rely on data 
collected from our Collabo-ratio visualisation,  

38
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:39,060
which tracks three key collaboration metrics: 
activity, influence and communication. In fact,  

39
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,080
Ayala leverages a CREST-Bot message to 
encourage Nick to participate in the task.

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,920
Ayala finds a nice property for the group that is  

41
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,740
close to the Empire State Building and 
decides to propose a contract for it.

42
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,360
The contract contains the terms and conditions 
of the team’s stay. Ayala leverages a CREST-Bot  

43
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,380
notification so that she and her team can reach 
the desired budget. Once that takes effect,  

44
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,560
she proceeds to sign the contract and 
sends a message to her group about it.

45
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,160
Nick sees Ayala mentioning him in 
the chat and proceeds to add his  

46
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,140
preferences. He notices Ayala’s property 
is a bit too pricy and proceeds to a near  

47
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,200
metro preference so that Ayala can take 
the metro to the Empire State Building.

48
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,640
Nick uses this new metro preference to look 
for a cheaper alternative and finds one  

49
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,900
thanks to a CREST-bot notification, which 
he uses to propose a new contract for it.

50
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,160
Nick starts working on the contract by 
also leveraging CREST-Bot interventions  

51
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,820
on matters of budget distribution and 
house rules creation. Nick offers to  

52
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,420
cook for everyone in the team but notices a 
CREST Bot notification saying that he should  

53
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,440
take out the apartment’s trash every week. 
Since he is paying very little for rent,  

54
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,060
he accepts this recommendation. He signs the 
contract and then updates the team in the chat.

55
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,200
Miguel logs in at some other time, and notices 
several contracts proposed. He sees that  

56
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,520
Ayala’s contract is ranked very low and sees a 
CREST-Bot notification saying that this contract  

57
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,860
doesn’t satisfy one of his preferences. He then 
sees that the contract proposed by Nick is highly  

58
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,060
ranked and is even recommended through a CREST-Bot 
notification, which he uses to open the contract.

59
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,440
Miguel likes this contract and likes the fact 
that he is paying less than his original budget.  

60
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,580
He sees a CREST-Bot recommendation telling him 
to create a house rule to justify him being the  

61
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,780
one paying the most for the team. He uses it to 
make things better for him and signs the contract

62
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,220
Ayala sees that her original contract is 
low in the ranked list and that two of  

63
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,820
her teammates have signed the contract for 
a property near the metro. She also sees  

64
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,540
that CREST-bot is encouraging her to take 
a look at this contract, so she opens it.  

65
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,540
She adds a few house rules to justify the daily 
habit of taking the metro and signs the contract. 

66
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,440
Now that they all signed and agreed on a property, 
the team can proceed to have fun in new york city.
