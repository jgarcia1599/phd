# PhD notes




## Objective
My intended PhD dissertation is on collaborative decision-making. This topic came to my attention after studying collaborative search and conflict mediation when working on CREST, a collaborative real-estate search tool designed to support a group of users to search for and agree on a property asynchronously, and studying a variety of misinformation-related papers when working on the Datavoids project. Both projects shed light on the fact that any collaboration endeavor is rendered useless if no decision is desired by the group. In CREST, the team needs to bear in mind that the final objective of booking a single property supersedes any and all collaboration issues that arise. In the misinformation/data voids projects, a group of  misinformation mitigators, usually in the form of a dedicated trust and safety team, need to collaborate to reach the final goal of freeing the masses from dangerous disinformation operations. A very exciting computational angle to this problem is uncertainty: how do collaborative decisions fare in highly uncertain environments? Does collaboration reduce the complexity brought forth by uncertainty through reduced cognitive overload and knowledge-sharing by the group?

As a way to keep myself motivated and accountable for the next few years, I decided to maintain this document where I will expansively collect resources that will inspire an ever-growing pipeline of projects I can work on. Following the advice of my wonderful advisor, I am practicing a "writing-first" approach where I materialize the convoluted, yet somewhat sensical, mess in my head and bring it from conception to fruition in what I hope are innovative and useful projects for the research community.

Computer science and economics have had a productive relationship over the past 25 years, resulting in a new field called algorithmic game theory or alternatively economics and computation. Many problems central to modern computer science, ranging from resource allocation in large networks to the design of blockchain protocols, fundamentally involve interactions between multiple self-interested parties. Economics and game theory offer a host of useful models and definitions to reason about such problems. The flow of ideas also travels in the other direction, with approximation and complexity notions playing an increasingly important role in the latest developments in economic theory. My textbook and accompanying lecture videos offer an accessible introduction to the subject, with case studies on online advertising, wireless spectrum auctions, kidney exchange, and network management.
