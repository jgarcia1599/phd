Assignments will be in python/matplotlib 

Book
	edward tufte envisioning information 
	visualization analysis and design 
	iee visualization and computer graphics 


final project is of ones own choosing 
- use ones own research project to motivate a vis project 
- reproduce academic article
- case study application development (real-world application scenario)

Go to office hours and discuss final project ideas 


survey paper = literature review and proposal for final project 


Mathematical foundations

- wavelength and physics as it relates to color


vector = direction and length
unit vector = length= 1, only direction
vector operations in cartesian coordinae = move x units, move y units
dot product = get angle between two vectors

use dot product to find projected lenght (distance of area that doesnt receive  sun when sunlight hits building)

find angles between vectors
