Psychological processes that drive destructive group behaviors

- deindividuation: a loss of self-awareness or sense of self when acting as part of a larger group or when over identifying with a specific social role
- diffusion of responsability

Asch conformity studies
Philip Zimbardo
Stanford Prison Experiment
Stanley Milgram's Yale Obedience Study

Conformity: A change in belief or behavior as a result of real or imagined group pressure

Obedience: An alteration of behavior in response to the direct orders of someone in a position of authority


conformity study would have been perfect ina. CREST type study

Factors that decreased conformity: If other engaged in dissent before the naive participant
Prior commitment to an initial judgement
Increase likelihood of conforming to the wrong answer: Unanimity,
If we are led to believe the group is comprised of experts
If members of the group are held in high esteem or important to the individua

Thesis statement
Topic ideas
- studying group think and cognitive convergence in online communities

Social media now acts as the breeding ground for several insurrections that have lead to mass destruction and instability at large. Cult-like insurgencies have been orchestrated entirely through social media platforms in a distributed manner, amplifying the voices of extremist groups/actors that where once at the peripheries of public discourse. Although the presence of anti-social behavior in online communities has been rigorously proved to be a problem in various peer-reviewed studies, the specific underpinning group mechanisms that lead a person to fall prey to such extremist tendencies requires further inquiry. In this paper, we will study the presence of groupthink and cognitive convergence in several Reddit conversations to understand what makes a person abandon their opinion to adopt the one of the dominant group they participate in. Quantifying this phenomenon, even in less-politically charged/simplistic settings, can provide insights into how thesegroup tendencies translate into the more dangerous settings. 

Extremist behaviours 

An insurgence of  political revolts, mass murders, and extremist mutiny has come as a result of the online communities that underpin them. The communities are born in social media platforms that have done little to no effort 



Sep 26
Thesis statement due next week
- What is the topic?
- So what? Why does this topic matter? is it applicable?
- Theoretical framework/perspective  for the analysis? what is the lense?
	- cognitive convergence?
	- radicalization?

Group decision-making is poorer than individual decision-making
the groupmind is not as savy as individual members mind
 biases that individuals have can be magnified or ionteract within groups 
	- information sampling bias
		- individuals will pool shared information more than individual information
	 - ownership bias
		 - information i bring is imore importatn than others information
	 - preference effect
		 - my preferences matter!

Groupthink: tendency of decision-making groups to strive for consensus and ignore or even stifle discordant information

willful ignorance

macro - systems/structures

social situation/context

micro personality/dispositions

illusions of group think: 
-  morality , vulnerability, unanimity

how do we counteract group think?

Sept 19


The discussion was about: 
 - The Banality of Extremism: The Role of Group Dynamics and Communication of Norms in Polarization on January 6
- What drove people normally not associated with far-right extremists to take part in the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol?
- A combination of many things: social media, polarization, extreme rhetoric, 
- groupthink: deterioration of personal-level thinking 
- This touches on what i read about auditing algorithms of Youtube ()
Coded bias documentary
collaborative vs content-based recommendation systems

GROUPTHINK: Where in the quadrant does it occur? 

Ingroup vs outgroup divisions: 
- we are prone to make categorizations automaticaly. 
- leadership , understress or we have to make a decision quickly. time and group size
- ingroup-bias: happens arbitrarily with anything
- outgroup members are heteregoeous. othering. 
- lab environment
	- give tokens 
- ethnocentrism 
- histility between different groups
	- scarcity of resources
	- threatening
	- violation of values/norms
	- polarization
- social comparison : upwards vs downwards
	- divide and conquer approach. LOOK THIS UP!
- privelege by proxy: systems justification
- easy exit for dissentors
- social identity
- acts of extremism can happen by anyone




Intragroup cooperation can be facilitated with intergroup competition. 
small group size leads to better cooperation with groups. Value-system is harder to mantain as groups get larger. 
Competition as an American cultural addiction.

How groups become increasingly polarized?

biredictional relationship between the macro/micro


macro
institutional/structural/systemic


micro
personality/disposition
social situation/context
social cognition occurs here


dont say society

cultural dimension - individualism vs collectivism
occurs at the macro level mostly, but there is discrepancies in the individual level

the wagner article of 95 talks about individualism vs collectivism


horizontal vs vertical manifestations affect individualism vs horizontal 


individualism
- self-interest
- independence
- self-reliance
- competition
collectivism
- people define themselves in terms of their place in the larger collective
- beahiviour is based on norm
- sense of self is attached to the larger community
- cooperation


Fundamental attribution error: their error is due to situation, not personality. people assign error to personality wrongly

self-serving biases = when our social cognition processes infomration in such a way that makes us look better/ look at things better/ make ourselves better

egocentric thought


horizontal orientation = suppoeths equality and values the freedom of indivuduals to be themselves

vertical = more rigid hierarchy, more emphasis on achievement and status

horizontal individualism = self-reliance and uniqueness and equality with others

vertical individualism = value of independence and autonomy and striving to be the best 

horizontal collectivism = u r in a groud but u dont care  that much about authority

vertical collectivism = more of an awaraness, susceptibility to authoritarianism

Theorizing Prejudice Reduction via Mediated Intergroup Contact
combining parasocial and vicarious contact to reduce prejudice reduction

Specifically, viewers may have mediated contact (parasocial or vicarious) with an ingroup or outgroup character or media figure, and such contact may lead to prejudice reduction through a series of mediated effects (see Figure 2)

stressors
- loneliness
- inter-role conflicts

- social networks
- social identity

- compliance and trus
- conspiracy theories
	- epistemic needs , why covid is happening


Future research may adapt and evaluate evidence-based interventions counteracting public disinformation (Bago et al., 2020; Pennycook et al., 2020; Roozenbeek et al., 2020) to fit the specific topic of conspiracy beliefs. Specifically, interventions breaking conspiracy narratives in the public discourse need to be complemented by evidencebased recommendations on addressing the conspiracy beliefs of friends and family 

Social networks
Four studies across Europe investigated social network structures during periods of nationwide lockdowns in spring 2020. Studies from Austria (Nitschke et al., 2021) and Italy (Liotta et al., 2020) indicated that stronger network ties were associated with fewer COVID-19 infections and less  2021 The Author(s).

- Week of september 5 top 3 articles i would like to facilitate this semester?
- October 3rd: Thesis statement, group dynamics
- November 7: Draft due of paper
- December 12: Final paper

Group Dynamics:
Need to belong is a pivotal and basic psychological property for every individual. 
The group is the primary way we get this. 
Our behavior is more prone to wrecklesmess, and it affects the larger group at large

what is group? = three or more people that interact with one another. 
what role does proximity play? some mutual benefit and purpose among the members.


3 levels of human behavior
- individual behavior (what role does personality play in my doings)
- intermediate  (social situation or context)
	- sense of self? is there a ground truth? cause it changes in group
- larger institutions, systems : how do they determine and define groups
reciprocal (two-way) influence ladder  amongst the three levels: which one is more important? 


Group formation and individualization are two aspects core to the human experience. 
- independence and differentiation are two important markers of the self

Group influence on us depends on the developmental period of our life (ie the family, the first group we belong)

The role of status within a group, what is it ? Hierarchy?

cohesiveness is generally positive, but to much cohesiveness is bad (radicalism)

norm theory is important in groups. it plays a regulatory function amongst members within groups

group size also matters

intergroup = between group
intragroup= within group



papers: scholarly articles , and its more of a lit review


the individual is not a killer, the group is
