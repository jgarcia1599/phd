Credibility can be defined as the perceived believability we have towards computers and is composed of two key elements: trustworthiness and expertise. Credibility is particularly important in human-computer interaction as it influences user trust and overall engagement with the digital content produced by computers. When it comes to credibility, trustworthiness captures the perceived goodness or morality of the source, which increases a computer's ability to persuade an user,  while expertise is the perceived knowledge and expertise of the source. One doesn't imply the other and computer products work best when they have both. 

The following are 3 situations where credibility impacts trustworthiness and expertise:

1. When computers teach: Particularly in computer-mediated e-learning systems, credibility increases when computers teach users as both trustworthiness and expertise increase. Users trust the content provided by the computer as they keep on learning more about the subject matter. The expertise of the computer also rises as a result as it acts as a form of teacher for the user. 
2. When computers report measurements: An example of this would be Google maps, as it tells users timely and updated information about reaching point A from point B and the user relies on this information on a daily basis to reach said destination. This increases trustworthiness because the user is able to arrive to the destination and expertise as the user continually relies on this product with little to no issue. 
3. When computers run simulation: In fields like scientific research, the computer's ability to empower scientists to run simulations such as running machine learning experiments is very important. The correctness of this simulations and the ease of producing increases both trustworthiness and expertise as the experience becomes less troublesome for the scientist.

Pick one of Fogg's persuasive technology tools mentioned in the reading, define the tool, and describe how it can be applied effectively in a real-world context. Perhaps propose a product or service with the tool.

In his book, BJ Fogg presents  seven types of persuasive technology tools:

Reduction
Tunneling
Tailoring
Suggestion
Self-monitoring
Surveillance
Conditioning

The tool I will focus on for this response is reduction, which basically boils down to making a complex task easier, which in turn increases the likelihood of a particular behavior by reducing the effort required to perform it. A great world example of reduction is Amazon's "1-Click Ordering", a service that simplifies the buying process by allowing users to make purchases with a single click, without having to go through the traditional multi-step checkout process.

How can the utilization of social interactions and aggregated user preferences contribute to more personalized and relevant search results? Post at least one pro and one con. Reply to other's posts and choose one con. Propose a solution to improve search functionalities while removing this con.

If search engines relied just on one or many queries to provide results, their recommendations would be rather simplistic and reductive as a query does not fully capture the complexity of thought behind the human mind. Sometimes, even users themselves struggle to put into words what it is that they are looking for. As such, one direct pro of incorporating societal interactions and user preferences is more personalization and increased relevance of the results. Social interactions are even more relevant in a collaborative search scenario, as these can better inform the search results that are relevant to the group as a whole.

One possible con of relying on social interactions to increase the relevance of the search results is that such might permeate existing biases that exist within the group, whether that is in a small, co-localized group through group thinking tendencies or a larger group through the form of echo chambers. Both of these can remove power from the user to engage in independent thinking and fall prey to the dangerous opinions of those that surround them. As such, it is important to provide mechanisms by which the user can protect themselves from these phenomena by allowing for customizations by the user to the algorithms that provide them with results. These can be formalized by a solution/tool that allows users to see the reasoning behind a specific search result so that the user can make an informed decision of whether or not this solution is safe for them to consider.

Consider the various factors influencing the timely user experience discussed in the book, including the importance of rapid response times, user expectations, and the nature of tasks. How do these factors impact user satisfaction and productivity in different interfaces, especially in the context of modern web-based designs and applications? Provide 3 examples of interfaces or systems that effectively balance rapid response times with the complexity of user tasks, and discuss the implications of such strategies on user engagement and overall experience. Use specific concepts mentioned in the reading.

Reply to other's posts and choose one example you have experience with. Give feedback on your personal experiences with that interface/system and if anything could be changed to improve user experience.
The book begins with a discussion by defining SRT (System Response Time) as the number of seconds it takes between an action done by the user in the interface and the time it takes for the interface to present feedback to the user. In general, you want your SRT to be as low as possible. Lengthy response times (more than 5 seconds) have shown to be detrimental for user productivity and satisfaction, whereas shorter response times are generally preferred. However, even these can cause users to stumble upon mistakes more often. As such, the book argues that the importance of SRT is highly dependent on the task and the expectations the user has for such a task. One example of this is Google Search. A lot of seminal work has been produced in the field of computer science and algorithm design to allow Google to index the entire internet efficiently and effectively respond to search queries in seconds. However, if a user inputs a complicated query, or does a reverse image search, the user adjusts their mental model of Google's response time to accommodate a longer SRT. Nonetheless, this SRT cannot be much longer, as Google has been able to deliver faster response times even in these edge-case scenarios. Another factor to consider is the complexity of the task itself. Users tend to build a correlation between the complexity of the task and its SRT; the easier the task, the lower the SRT. As such, web applications must accommodate this expectation. For instance, although Google Docs is praised for its collaboration capabilities, users expect that typing on a document occurs as quickly as writing, despite the costly engineering efforts under the hood that allow for asynchronous collaboration.On the other hand, heavy-duty processing applications such as video-editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro, 3D-rendering platforms like Blender, and large-scale data analysis platforms like BigML are expected to have longer response times due to the complexity of the tasks they handle. Users tend to be more understanding of these longer response times as a result.

Provide an example of a product that you believe could benefit from an iterative design approach. What is the current state and problems of the product? What specific improvements or changes could be made at each iteration? Reply to otherâ€™s posts with your opinion on the proposed changes and provide 3 pieces of feedback on the effectiveness of the iterative approach.

An example of a product that could benefit from more rounds of iteration in the iterative design approach presented in the book (inception -> requirement analysis -> preliminary detailed design -> build and implementation -> evaluation -> deployment) is the online portals of most healthcare providers I've used. While these portals serve as repositories of general information regarding the benefits of my plan and offer limited functionality for processing medical claims and refunds, they often lack attention to the user experience. However, considering the competitiveness of the US private health insurance market, a superior user experience could potentially lead to significant profit margins for the company.

In the requirements analysis phase, as a user of these products, I can attest to the need for a one-stop shop for all my medical needs within a single platform and addressing the issue of disconnected tools and services is crucial in this regard. During the preliminary detailed design phase, I would create mockups to illustrate how booking an online appointment could seamlessly integrate into the online portal, allowing users to schedule appointments for different doctors and hospitals within the portal without leaving the platform.

In the build and implementation phase, a significant effort would be dedicated to integrating the product with third-party APIs from various hospitals and medical service providers, providing users with a comprehensive experience in one place. This integration would then undergo rigorous testing with different user groups, and further iterations would be carried out if necessary.

One of the few examples I could think of when seeing these rules is Apple products in general, but more specifically, the iPhone. It's consistent through its elegant, sleek design. It's designed for universal usability through features like Voiceover for people with hearing disabilities. All actions provide immediate feedback. Downloading an application, for instance, is visually representative through the gradual fading in of the app on the home screen as it downloads. Its adherence to these rules has made it succeed over objectively more powerful phones in the market. Another example is Google Drive. This cloud management system follows all eight rules, the most noteworthy of which is its ease of use. Its integration into the more extensive suite of Google Apps and services provides many benefits for users who rely on these services for other reasons. This makes this product superior to Dropbox, for instance, a product that might be more advanced regarding on-device file management. Adhering to these eight rules made Google Drive and the iPhone more successful than its competitors. Some Windows PCs are examples of products that do not adhere to these rules and suffer because of it. Although less frequent, some users still struggle with endless update cycles with little to no feedback on their progress, limited accessibility features, and ease of usage.

Artificial Constraints: I like how the book admitted that natural mappings and constraints sometimes can't be achieved. As such, one can standardize the mechanism to use the system once intuitively to prevent confusion later. Electronic medical records are an example of a product that could benefit from standardization. Almost all hospitals, insurance providers, and medical institutions have their own way of formatting these documents. This becomes even more of a problem on an international scale. By standardizing how these documents are formatted collaboratively amongst all possible participating parties, the ease of use of the records, especially by layman users, will be improved.Â 

Natural Mappings: A product that could have better utilized natural mappings is my headphones. I must press tiny buttons on the lower edge near my left ear to lower the volume or stop a song. I often mix these buttons up and use my phone to adjust the volume or pause songs. A more intuitive position would be on the side of the headphones, directly over my ear, especially when I instinctively want to press near my ear to stop a song. These echoes what Norman said about response compatibility, as the controls feel more intuitive on top of my ear as thats what I would my hands normally go when I cover my ears at the presence of loud sounds. 

Natural Constraints: A product that could benefit from natural constraints is my door lock. I often turn it in the wrong direction and frequently insert the incorrect key, only to realize after a few twists that the door won't open. While natural constraints are the reason only one key can open a specific door, I would enhance these constraints to prevent the wrong key from being inserted in the first place.

Hello all, 

The following are the goals I chose for Assignment 1: 
Goal 3 Good Health and Well-being: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all
ages
Goal 4 Quality Education: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote
lifelong learning opportunities for all
Goal 16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for
sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and
inclusive institutions at all levels.

I am particularly excited for Goal 16 as I believe there are some exciting design solutions that can be explored to protect individuals from larger, more corrupt institutions. This is something especially important to me as I come from a country where larger societal institutions are rarely held accountable for the damage they cause to people. I also think Goal 3 is interesting, especially within the context of bullying/harassment that occurs in social media and online communities. 

In terms of skills, I have full-stack web development experience and some understanding of basic machine learning models. I worked in Computer Science research lab before grad school, mostly helping in a variety of HCI projects in topics like computer-supported collaborative work and misinformation. I really enjoy reading/writing about HCI related topics, so I feel particularly adept at scouring the literature for inspiration that we can then use to make something awesome!

What are the two deadly temptations for the designer listed in the reading? For each, define the temptation and give an example of a product where the design has fallen to a temptation and be sure to list which temptation. Reply to otherâ€™s posts with how users can protect themselves against each temptation example.

The two most deadly temptations for a designer are "creeping futurism" and the "worshipping of false images."

1. **Creeping Futurism**: This refers to a designer's inclination to overcomplicate a product by incessantly adding features. Even though these additions might be made with good intentions, they can lead to a product that is confusing or overwhelming for the user. An example of this might be Microsoft Office 365 suite of apps. Although some features within some of the apps are very well designed, the tendency to cover all possible use cases tends to leave some of the products at the sideline,  like Microsoft Access and Microsoft Publisher. As highlighted in the book, "No constraints lead to no affordances; invisible, arbitrary mappings." The solution to this problem lies in restraint. Designers should consider modularizing features, presenting them to users only when necessary and allowing access to specialized modules as needed. This is what Microsoft does with its products by modularizing all of the features aimed at helping everyday knowledge worker to different applications.

3. **Worshipping of False Images**: This temptation is about valuing a misguided vision of the product over its actual utility. For example, both users and designers might prioritize technical complexity, elevating it as the primary goal. In doing so, they might overlook the importance of creating a usable product. An example of this would be Google Glass, a product where the creators where so infatuated by creating something new and innovative that support of simple glass requirements like look, feel, and just natural usability, rendered the product a failure.

difference between semantic and cultural constraints, a lot of difficulties understanding this term. 

A persona is best realized when you think of the n-word: NEEDS

how is a persona different from a market segment?

Weekly Prompt Response
What are the four classes of constraints? Define each type and give an example of each. Respond to otherâ€™s posts with the following: if any of the items are of good design then how are the itemâ€™s affordances working hand in hand with its constraints? If any of the items in the examples are of poor design, how can they be improved?

**Physical  :**Â These constraints are determined by the physical properties of a system. An example is the cap of a water bottle. Its shape, size, and physical characteristics, such as the threaded design inside the cap that matches the bottle's neck, ensure a tight seal.

**Semantic Constraints:**Â These constraints are based on the meaning of the situation and control the set of possible actions afforded by the tool. An example would be a teapot. Its handle, combined with a situation where one needs to pour tea, leads the user to conclude that the handle is meant for holding the teapot.

**Cultural Constraints:**Â These are guidelines for using a tool that are dictated by societal expectations. For instance, chopsticks are held in a specific manner due to cultural conventions established by the societies that use them. Yet, based on their physical characteristics alone, there could be numerous ways to use them.

**Logical Constraints:**Â These constraints depend on the user's logical reasoning for usage.Â  An example is the keypad of a phone. Given the way humans count, the numbers are arranged logically in increasing order from left to right.


Reading Notes Norman's Design of Everyday thing Chapter 3 and 4

In everyday situations, behavior is determined by the combination of internal knowledge and external information and constraints. People routinely capitalize on this fact.

People function through their use of two kinds of knowledge: knowledge of and knowledge how.
Knowledge of - declarative knowledge - includes the knowledge\memorization of facts and rules

knowledge how - procedural knowledge - comes with practice , taught through demonstration, difficult to write down by memory

The power of constraints makes it easy to memorize a poem because there is only a limited number of words with a specific meaning that rhyme. 

We have long term memory and short-term memory. For our purposes, the following are important memory categories: 
Memory for arbitrary things. The items to be retained seem arbitrary, with no meaning and no particular relationship to one other or to things already known. 
Memory for meaningful relationships. The items to be retained form meaningful relationships with themselves or with other things already known. 
Memory through explanation. The material does not have to be remembered, but rather can be derived from some explanatory mechanism.

The arrangement of burners and controls on the kitchen stove provides a good example of the power of natural mappings to reduce the need for information in memory. Without a good mapping, the user cannot readily determine which burner goes with which control.


Difference between knowledge in the world and knowledge in our head when users interact with products. 

Affordances suggest the range of possibilities, constraints limit the number of alternatives.


A limited-piece lego set is a good example of constraints

four different classes of constraintsâ€”physical, semantic, cultural, and logical.

constraints and mappings help us know what to do when we see a product. Also: 
1.Visibility. Make relevant parts visible. 
Feedback. Give each action an immediate and obvious effect.

New technologies, especially the inexpensive microprocessors available today (the heart of the computer) make possible the incorporation of powerful and intelligent systems even in simple, everyday things, from toys to kitchen appliances to office machines. But new capabilities must be accompanied by appropriate displays, also now relatively inexpensive.


Week 1 discussion prompt

What are the differences between the Gulf of Execution and Gulf of Evaluation and how they are overcome? Give an example of a situation and product in which a designer may have to connect and bridge the two gulfs and how they would do so.


While the Gulf of Execution relates to the gap that exists between what the user intends to do with the product and the actions actually supported by the system, the Gulf of Evaluation relates to the ability of the system to relay back to the user information (or feedback) about the current state in which the system is engaged. While a system might have different physical affordances (i.e. buttons) in it that allows the user to achieve their desired actions (small gulf of execution), it doesn't necessarily mean that the system is able to intuitively show its current state of affairs. The inverse of this also applies, tools with good feedback mechanisms might suffer from a limited ability to support a user's actions. The book provides a natural template we can leverage to eliminate the possibility of these gulfs from occurring, presented as the seven stages of action. Â 

An example of a product that might suffer from both gulfs is a professional camera. While a basic camera only needs a one button to function properly, a professional camera is often designed for users who have more requirements for the photos they want to produce, which results in a more complicated camera that has more functionalities. Maybe a significant portion of the camera's user base requires the ability to capture long-range shots. Here, the gulf of execution is present as the actions the user requires are not natively supported by the product. As a result, a designer creates an add-on lens that can be attached to the camera and it can be adjusted to accommodate a larger distance between the photographer and the photo's subject. To prevent the gulf of evaluation, the designer preemptively thinks ahead and adds a small screen to the side of the lens that shows the user the distance the camera can be from the photo's subject. Here, the designer was able to minimize both gulfs. This was primarily achieved through the 7 stages of actions framework: forming the intention (using the professional camera to achieve this goal), specifying an action (attaching the add-on lens for enhanced range), executing the action (adjusting the lens to the desired distance setting), perceiving the state of the world (looking at the side screen to see the distance the camera can be from the subject), interpreting the state of the world (understanding the distance reading and making necessary adjustments), and finally, evaluating the outcome (checking the quality of the photo taken and ensuring the desired range was achieved).

Who is a user? a human who interacts with a tool.

what is an experience? an event or ocurrence which leaves an impression on a group of humans

think of problems first, technology comes after

finding info = information architecture
getting stuff done = interaction design
aesthetics = visual design

human-centered design = feasibility, desirability, and viability
desirability
- will this fill a need?, will people want it?
feasibility = is technology needed to power the design solution?
