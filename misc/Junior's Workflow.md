In here, I will lay out the internals of my research workflow. One thing I enjoy a lot about research is the opportunity of learning from the work of greats before me. I rely on their work, their mistakes, their strokes of genius, to incentivize my own work. 

After completing the first semester of my PhD, I realized I did a lot of the things I described in the workflow here but still needed to cement the actual process for myself to actually ingrain the knowledge both in my brain and in this vault in a way that is organized and sustainable over time. Thankfully, I challenged myself to create this workflow early enough in my PhD to make my life easier later. 

I also realized that doing a PhD requires systematically navigating vast seas of knowledge in order to create something innovative that has never been done before. With all of the responsibilities assigned to a PhD student, I believe it is unrealistic and borderline impossible to expect the student to inspect every single drop of water in such vast seas. A better alternative is to design a route, a path, a system that allows you to navigate such seas. You also don't need to swim through such seas, you can use a boat. This right here is my boat, and my research mentors, family, and friends are my crew. 


Data Collating
- Use Zotero to quickly gather all of the bibliographical information/pdf of the research articles I find online with just their DOI
- Using the Zotero extension, I can quickly do this as I browse through articles in the web.
- One think I have setup currently is that the pdfs that are collected in the zotero database are also available in the literature/ folder in my obsidian vault. 
	- **Explain how this setup works here**
	- Painp points: 
		- remove duplicated pdfs
		- change naming structure of the ofd
		- something the pdfs dont automatically appear in my vault and i have to look for them wherever zotero saves them in my machine
		- Right now , all the folders appear in the root of the folder. To be honest, I enjoy the simplicity of this as having / keeping up / updating a thematic folder structure really scares me. This might be something I work on later but for now I just want to have the pdfs directly accesible in my obsidian vault for the note taking stage later. 

To do: I would want to somehow centralize my obsidian fault and be able to also send articles to zotero as I am browsing them in my phone. 

Data Processing 
- I like to select a few articles to read and highlight the pdf as I go along. I want the highlighted text to be available directly in markdown in an obsidian note and I currently rely on is obsidian annotator: https://github.com/elias-sundqvist/obsidian-annotator
	- Pain points:
		- Note creation: I always forget how to create a literature note and I always have to reteach myself how to do it
			- I always have to find the absolute path of the pdf and there is no recommendations as I type the pdf name in the search bar, that would be useful
			- **Progress**: using templater (https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater/discussions/1170), i managed to create a note in the literature_notes folder by doing command + shift + l > Select 'Annotation and Templater' template
				- current error: i can only create a single note cause i have a placeholder name for the paper name in the title (DATE_PLACEHOLDER.md). it would be cool to provide the paper name as a form of variable. even more coool would that this variable is somehow the pdf itself i want to annotate with. 
- Once i have highlighted the pdf, I should move it to literature notes
- To get the pdf file exact path, I can use the search bar and use file: to look for the pdf within thevault. once i open it, i can leverage the Show current File Path extension to copy the file path from the bottom right panel. 

Insight Formulation (In progress)
- Aim to create one insight note once a week about the papers I have read since the previous note
- Maybe read up on zettelkasten a bit so I can use their philosoophy to drive what I do here
- This should be a form of meta-thinking, a way to formulate research ideas based on what I have read
- Since I learn by doing, I should formulate clear action items of research prototypes/ quick scripts I could do to realize my ideas.
