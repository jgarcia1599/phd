Status-Meeting Protocols from A world without email by Cal Newport


SCORE: a modified-scrum for research
Answer 3 questions: 
- What did you do since last scrum meeting?
- Do you have any obstacles?
- What will you do before next scrum?

Separate status meetings from involved technical discussions


Just having a long meeting is an abdication of responsability, an admission you are not organized enough to accomplish something independently. Quick status meetings empower you to get more done and dont allow you to cover up your work with doublesepak. 


Task boards

- task board cards should be clear and informative
- basic columns: to, doing done
	- at huda, we have a discuss column where I put stuff i need to discuss with azza. we also have a waiting to hear back, if its something i need from azza or someone else, and a impirtant links column to keep important links. 
- Use card conversations to replace hivemind chatter

Indiviudal task boards 
- use more than one board: one per role, one board per project. 2-4 boards is a helathy number
- schedule regular solo-review meetings
- add a to discuss column, this is crucial for meetings
- "waiting to hear back" column
