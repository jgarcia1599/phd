Decision making under uncertainty course at stanford: https://aa228.stanford.edu/


Main HCI conferences to aim for 

CHI 
CSCW
UIST
IUI



Azzas initial advice
- grades are not that important, algorithms should be the one course i need to do well
- 1 paper a year, you are ok, but better 2 papers a day : 1-2 papers a year
- current ideas: crest continuation, tool that helps misinformation mitigators
- two books: atomic habits, deep work
- using spreadsheets and tableau as vis
- what are the main conferences i should aim for : cscw, uist, chi, iui
- establish a habit of writing first
- create an idea pipeline
- collaborative decision-making

- aiding decision-making like with CREST BOT
- how to build tools that help decision makers tackling disinformation: Azza will send papers regarding this
- survey paper is good, keep it running, its something that comes naturally after a couple of years

- Dataexploration: Use simple tools before scripting like vegalite or tableau
- writing: dont be afraid of azza think of it as taking notes
- expand uncertainty 
- Get a tutor for algorithms??
